# Data Engineering Pareto Principle Analysis


## Overview

This repository contains the code and results of a Data Engineering analysis inspired by the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule). The analysis was initiated by a Reddit post in the r/dataengineering subreddit, seeking insights into the most valuable Python libraries and modules for Data Engineering.

### Reddit Post

"I was wondering in Data Engineering what are the most useful libraries that someone should skill up on, so I decided to ask Reddit. I created a post in the r/dataengineering subreddit: Python Pareto Principle - what is the 20% (algos, functions, libraries) that lets you develop 80% of code related to Data Engineering?"

This question sparked a vibrant discussion, leading to the creation of this project.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Collection**: Reddit comments were scraped using the Reddit API.
- **Data Analysis**: Comments were loaded and analyzed with Talend Open Studio and MySQL.
- **Visualization**: Results were visualized using Power BI, revealing the most useful Python libraries/modules for Data Engineering.
